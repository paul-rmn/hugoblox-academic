abstract: In this paper, we prove strong subconvexity bounds for self-dual
  $\textrm{GL}(3)$ $L$-functions in the $t$-aspect and for
  $\textrm{GL}(3)\times\textrm{GL}(2)$ $L$-functions
  in the $\textrm{GL}(2)$-spectral aspect. The bounds are strong in the sense that they
  are the natural limit of the moment method pioneered by Xiaoqing Li, modulo current
  knowledge on estimates for the second moment of $\textrm{GL}(3)$ $L$-functions on
  the critical line.
