abstract: We prove a reciprocity formula for the average of the product of Rankin--Selberg
  $L$-functions $L(1/2,\Pi\times\widetilde{\sigma})L(1/2,\sigma\times\widetilde{\pi})$
  as $\sigma$ varies over automorphic representations of $\mathrm{PGL}(n)$ over
  a number field $F$, where $\Pi$ and $\pi$ are cuspidal automorphic representations of
  $\mathrm{PGL}(n+1)$ and $\mathrm{PGL}(n-1)$ over $F$, respectively.
  If $F$ is totally real, and $\Pi$ and $\pi$ are tempered everywhere, we
  deduce simultaneous non-vanishing of these $L$-values for certain sequences
  of $\sigma$ with conductor tending to infinity in the level
  aspect and bearing certain local conditions.
