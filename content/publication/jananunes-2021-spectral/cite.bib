 abstract = {We prove a reciprocity formula for the average of the product of Rankin--Selberg \$L\$-functions \$L(1/2,\Pi\times\widetilde\\sigma\)L(1/2,\sigma\times\widetilde\\pi\)\$ as \$\sigma\$ varies over automorphic representations of \$\mathrm\PGL\(n)\$ over a number field \$F\$, where \$\Pi\$ and \$\pi\$ are cuspidal automorphic representations of \$\mathrm\PGL\(n+1)\$ and \$\mathrm\PGL\(n-1)\$ over \$F\$, respectively. If \$F\$ is totally real, and \$\Pi\$ and \$\pi\$ are tempered everywhere, we deduce simultaneous non-vanishing of these \$L\$-values for certain sequences of \$\sigma\$ with conductor tending to infinity in the level aspect and bearing certain local conditions.},
