If \$F\$ is totally real, and \${\textbackslash}Pi\$ and \${\textbackslash}pi\$ are tempered everywhere, we deduce simultaneous non-vanishing of these \$L\$-values for certain sequences of \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ with conductor tending to infinity in the level aspect and bearing certain local conditions.},
